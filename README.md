# C# Class Diagram
A class diagram designer in C# in Windows Presentation Foundation made in 2016.

The program is designed with the model-view-view-model software architecture. Here, the GUI is designed in XAML as the view, the model is kept as a seperate project in the Visual Studio solution, and the view-model exposes the relevant model data to the view through data-binding.

The program contains a few examples of how unit tests works in C#, but this project was not made with test-driven development.
